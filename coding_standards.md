# Coding Standards

These are the coding standards I follow on this project.

* Yes to exceptions
* No to C-style casts ( "(int)1.5" )
* Use "#pragma once" rather than header guards
** (This is because this project is already Windows-only, and the pragma is prettier :)
* Follow Google style formatting, except that we indent 4 spaces, not 2.
